## Project Summary

* Target users: The target users will be anyone who need to co-work. In the workplace, it is necessary to use various tools and communicate with other colleagues.

* Pain points: Many people might have experience in being mentioned  from various tools. It might cause unnecessary delay in work process or inefficient communication costs.

* Concept: We will introduce MentionZip to solve that problem. It is kind of a zip file dashboard of all tools assigned to users. It displays all mentioned contents on users with two sections so users can easily manage their tasks by ‘done’ it. It offers instant contents so users could complete their tasks as soon as possible.  

* Vision: It will reduce workload by automatically integrated all tools and minimizing communication costs by not missing all mentioned tasks.

* Main technique: Azure, SSL + Nginx + Https, Java + Spring Boot, Swagger
